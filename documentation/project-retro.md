## Capstone project sprint retro

What went well:
* Core functionality works as planned at start of sprint
* Wrote code that was reusable, so development of some later features was quicker - for example, filtered search was the last feature to be added but mostly used functions I had already written for other parts of the application
* Planning was thorough enough that I always knew what I would be working on next
* Detailed routing diagrams made it easy to develop and test the backend routes
* Deployed early as this was new to me, and didn't want to leave this as a panic for last day
* Worked in slices including testing


What didn't go well:
* Could have been quicker at testing front end - working out what to test and how to test took some time
* As a result, didn't manage to thoroughly test some elements of the front end
* Planned the backend to be made using microservices but midway through decided to switch to single service - migration went fairly smoothly but took time
* Could have asked for help more often

What I would do given more time:
* Delete Rate function for users and admins
* More app navigation options - search for specific coffee shops by name, see all Rates submitted by a specific user
* Search for specific coffee shop would also allow user to add a rate more quickly
* Longer term features - map with pins, alternative milk, iced coffee functionality etc, better handling of chain coffee shops
